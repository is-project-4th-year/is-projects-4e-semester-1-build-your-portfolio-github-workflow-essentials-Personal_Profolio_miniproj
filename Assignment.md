## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

List at least **four key concepts or skills** you learned during the Git crash course. For each one, write a brief explanation of how it helped you manage your portfolio project more effectively.

- **Using Milestones and Issues:** Breaking the portfolio into smaller tasks will be easier using GitHub Issues and grouping them into milestones. This helped me keep things under control. It gave me a clear plan of what needed to be done and made the process not feel so daunting.
- **Commit Messages:** Writing clear, descriptive commit messages helped me keep track of the work I did and why. It was easier to understand the project status and debug bugs.
- **Merging:** Being able to merge branches came in handy in merging different features like the contact form and animations without losing any progress and significant conflicts.
- **Deploying Apps with GitHub:** Learning how to deploy my portfolio site with GitHub Pages made it simple for me to easily share a live copy of my work. It was faster and let me test how everything looked and functioned online.
