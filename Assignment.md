## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

### Concept 1: GitHub Project Boards  
**Expectation:** Thought it was a project management tool used only by large teams.  
**Reality:** It’s basically a Kanban board — easy to drag issues and visualize tasks.  
**Impact:** Helped me break my portfolio into smaller tasks and track progress easily.

### Concept 2: Commit Conventions  
**Expectation:** Seemed like something advanced or optional.  
**Reality:** Turned out to be a clear way to track changes and make commits readable.  
**Impact:** Helped me stay organized when working with multiple branches and features.

### Concept 3: Pull Requests  
**Expectation:** I thought PRs were only for big open-source projects.  
**Reality:** PRs made it easy to review changes even as a solo dev.  
**Impact:** Allowed me to track features, simulate merge conflicts and work neatly.

### Concept 4: Merge Conflict Resolution  
**Expectation:** Thought it would be scary or technical to resolve.  
**Reality:** It's just a matter of reading changes carefully and choosing what stays.  
**Impact:** Gave me confidence to handle Git in real-world scenarios.

### Final Note
This documentation reflects how I used GitHub not just for version control, but as a complete project management toolkit — from planning and organizing to resolving conflicts and deploying a professional portfolio.
