## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

**What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes 😅).
For each one, tell us:

What you thought it would be like `(Expectation 👀)`

What you actually learned `(Reality 😅)`

And how it helped with your personal portfolio project 💻

**Example format:**

`Concept: GitHub Project Boards`

`Expectation 👀`: Looked like a complicated tool only teams use.

`Reality 😅`: It’s actually a visual to-do list! Dragging my tasks from “To do” to “Done” felt so satisfying.

`Impact 💡`: Helped me stay organized and track my progress on the portfolio, especially when I had lots of sections to build.


## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
> (you could just simply copy and paste the image into the Assignment.md)

```markdown
![Caption](path/to/your/image.png)
