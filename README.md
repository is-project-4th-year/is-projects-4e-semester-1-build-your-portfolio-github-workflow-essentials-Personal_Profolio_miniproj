### 🛠️ Development Workflow 

#### 📋 Branching and Commits

- For each issue, create a feature branch  
  Example: `git checkout -b feature/home-page`  
- Commit regularly with clear messages referencing issues  
  Example: `feat: add intro section to Home (#1)`  
- Use commit keywords to link and close issues  
  Example: `Closes #2`

#### 🔁 Pull Requests (PRs)

- For every feature, open a Pull Request to `main`  
- Use descriptive titles (e.g., Add Projects Section)  
- In PR body, mention which issue it closes  
- Merge PRs after reviewing and testing locally

________________________________________

### 🌐 Deployment 

- Make sure all features are merged into `main`
